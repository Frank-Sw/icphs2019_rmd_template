\begin{abstract}
This is the layout specification and template definition for the papers of 
ICPhS XIX (the 19th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, which will be 
held in Melbourne, Australia, August 5-9, 2019). This template is a revised 
version of the one used for Glasgow ICPhS XVIII in 2015, originally generated 
from the template for Speech Prosody 2006 in Dresden.

The abstract may consist of more than one paragraph but must be kept within a 
150 word limit. This abstract will be printed in the abstract booklet to be 
given out at the conference.
